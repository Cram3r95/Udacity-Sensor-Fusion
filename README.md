# Udacity Sensor Fusion Nanodegree Program Projects

This is the primary repository for all my projects completed during the Udacity Sensor Fusion Engineering Program.

## Setup

After cloning this repository, the individual projects can be initialized in the ```projects``` directory by running:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

All projects are written in C++, and are built using `CMake`, except for `Sensor-Fusion-Radar-Target-Gen-and-Detection`, which requires the use of MATLAB.
